# Memory Patch Database
This is a collection of old and new memory patches for Games, Software and Hardware.

## Why?
As it turns out, our species really sucks at creating permanent records, especially detailed ones. A lot of information is simply lost to time, no matter how important it might have been. It doesn't matter where you look, every field has lost some information or technology due to the passage of time, and often due to simple greed. I myself have even seen information in the field I work in be lost, which used to be common knowledge.

In recent times, people have come the realize the value of this lost information, and started efforts to prevent information loss. One of these is [archive.org](https://archive.org/), a collective effort to archive data that has entered the public domain. Even though some to-stay-unnamed entities had greed flash in their eyes, thankfully politicians have prevented the total loss of this data so far.

As for this, it's my attempt at preserving memory patches for Games, Software and Hardware in a way where others can contribute directly. Perhaps someone will even go out of their way to write new memory patches in the future.
